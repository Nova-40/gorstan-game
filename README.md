## ðŸ¤– NPC Intelligence (v4.0.0-preprod-r2)

Gorstan includes a modular deterministic AI system for NPCs:
- **Contextual Responses** based on player memory and actions
- **NPC Memory Engine** tracks past conversations, trust, and key topics
- **Reactive Behaviours** like Dominic remembering past deaths or resets
- Each NPC has:
  - A `knowledge` array (what they can speak about)
  - A `responses` dictionary keyed to topics
  - A `npcReact()` function that uses player state to deliver meaningful, unique feedback

This system is found in:
- `src/engine/npcEngine.js`
- `src/engine/npcMemory.js`
