// === AppCore_optimized.tsx ===
// Note: This was an optimized version of AppCore that was superseded

// === DialogueTreeEngine.ts ===
// Note: This appears to be a legacy JavaScript file that was converted
// to TypeScript. The functionality is now handled by dialogueEngine.ts

// === enhancedWanderingNPCController.ts ===
// Note: Enhanced NPC controller that was superseded by the main
// wanderingNPCController.ts with 45% spawn system implementation

// === roomNPCCleaner.ts ===
// Note: Utility for cleaning NPC assignments from room files
// This was used during the cleanup process and is no longer needed
// as the cleanup has been completed

// === trapTester.ts ===
// Note: Testing utility for trap system validation
// The trap system is now fully operational and validated

// === testItemManagement.ts ===
// Note: Testing utility for item management system
// Item system is now validated and operational

// Note: Patched version of command parser - superseded by main implementation

// From enhancedWanderingNPCController.ts - Multi-NPC encounter logic
// (This was already integrated into wanderingNPCController.ts)

   CLEANUP NOTES
   ===============================================
   
   Files removed during cleanup:
   - AppCore_optimized.tsx (replaced by main AppCore.tsx)
   - DialogueTreeEngine.ts (legacy JS file)
   - enhancedWanderingNPCController.ts (integrated into main controller)
   - roomNPCCleaner.ts (utility completed its purpose)
   - trapTester.ts (testing utility no longer needed)
   - testItemManagement.ts (testing utility no longer needed)
   - commandParser.patched.ts (superseded by main implementation)
   - introZone_introreset.patched.ts (superseded by main implementation)
   
   These files were removed because:
   1. They were not imported or used anywhere in the codebase
   2. They were superseded by better implementations
   3. They were temporary utilities that completed their purpose
   4. They were legacy/experimental code that was abandoned
