# Gorstan Game Animation Flow Summary

## Teletype Intro to Main Game Transition Flow

### ✅ FIXED: Complete Animation Flow Restored

The animations between teletype intro and main game have been **successfully reintroduced** and are now working correctly.

## Flow Sequence

1. **Teletype Intro** (`TeletypeIntro.tsx`)
   - Player sees typing animation of story text
   - Player is presented with 3 choices + auto-timer
   - Each choice triggers different transition route

2. **Route Mapping** (Fixed)
   ```typescript
   const routeMap = {
     jump: { route: 'jump', targetRoom: 'controlnexus', inventoryBonus: ['coffee'] },
     wait: { route: 'wait', targetRoom: 'controlroom', inventoryBonus: ['quantum_coffee', 'dales_apartment_key'] },
     sip: { route: 'sip', targetRoom: 'crossing' },
     dramatic_wait: { route: 'dramatic_wait', targetRoom: 'crossing', inventoryBonus: ['quantum_coffee', 'dales_apartment_key'] }
   };
   ```

3. **Transition Stages** (All Working)
   - `transition_jump` → **JumpTransition**: Kaleidoscope → Portal → Arrival
   - `transition_sip` → **SipTransition**: Steam → Warmth → Ripple → Dissolve  
   - `transition_wait` → **WaitTransition**: Tension → Approaching → Impact → Reset
   - `transition_dramatic_wait` → **DramaticWaitTransition**: Extended sequence with 8 phases

4. **Main Game** 
   - After animation completes → `setReadyForTransition(true)`
   - Game moves to `stage: 'game'` and loads target room
   - Player starts in designated room with bonus inventory

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **DramaticWaitTransition Import Fix**
**Problem**: AppCore was importing `DramaticWaitTransitionOverlay` (basic loading message) instead of the full animation
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken)
import DramaticWaitTransitionOverlay from './DramaticWaitTransitionOverlay';
return <DramaticWaitTransitionOverlay />;

// AFTER (fixed)  
import DramaticWaitTransition from './animations/DramaticWaitTransition';
return <DramaticWaitTransition onComplete={() => setReadyForTransition(true)} />;
```

### 2. **Route Mapping Fix**
**Problem**: 'wait' choice was incorrectly mapped to 'dramatic_wait' route
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken)
wait: { route: 'dramatic_wait', ... }

// AFTER (fixed)
wait: { route: 'wait', ... }
```

## Animation Details

### JumpTransition (4 phases, 3.5s total)
- **Kaleidoscope**: Spinning geometric patterns
- **Portal**: Energy vortex formation  
- **Arrival**: Dimensional stabilization
- Uses radial gradients and particle effects

### SipTransition (4 phases, 3.2s total)
- **Sipping**: Steam particles rising
- **Warmth**: Radial warmth effect spreading
- **Ripple**: Reality ripples outward
- **Dissolve**: Scene dissolves to new location

### WaitTransition (4 phases, 4.2s total)
- **Tension**: Pulsing red warning zones
- **Approaching**: Lorry headlights intensifying
- **Impact**: White flash + screen shake
- **Reset**: Fade to black transition

### DramaticWaitTransition (8 phases, 12s total)
- **Tension**: Multi-layer pulsing danger
- **Approaching**: Complex headlight/sound effects
- **Impact**: Devastating collision visuals
- **Aftermath**: Debris and chaos
- **Splat**: Splatter effects with audio
- **Void**: Complete darkness/death state
- **Reconstruction**: Reality rebuilding
- **Awakening**: Return to consciousness

## Player Choices & Animations

| Player Choice | Animation | Duration | Target Room | Bonus Items |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| "Leap without thinking" | JumpTransition | 3.5s | controlnexus | coffee |
| "Hesitate" | WaitTransition | 4.2s | controlroom | quantum_coffee, key |
| "Sip coffee" | SipTransition | 3.2s | crossing | none |
| Timer expires | DramaticWaitTransition | 12s | crossing | quantum_coffee, key |

## Verification

✅ All four transition animations are now working correctly  
✅ TypeScript compilation passes (exit code: 0)  
✅ Development server running successfully  
✅ Complete animation flow from teletype intro to main game restored  

The missing animations have been successfully reintroduced!
