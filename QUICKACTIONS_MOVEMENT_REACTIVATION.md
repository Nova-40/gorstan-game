# QuickActionsPanel Movement Buttons Reactivation

## ✅ COMPLETED: Movement Buttons Successfully Reactivated

The movement buttons in the QuickActionsPanel have been successfully reactivated for development and testing.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
The movement buttons were **not broken** - they were **inactive because the game was not in the main game stage**. The QuickActionsPanel is only rendered when `stage === 'game'`, but the game starts in `stage === 'splash'` and requires completing the full intro sequence:

```
splash → welcome → nameCapture → intro → transition → game
```

### The Solution
**Development Mode Bypass**: Modified the initial game state to skip directly to the main game stage during development:

```typescript
// gameState.tsx - Initial State
stage: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? STAGES.GAME : STAGES.SPLASH,
player: {
  name: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'TestPlayer' : '',
  // ... other player properties
}
```

## Current Functionality

### ✅ Available Movement Buttons
Based on the `controlnexus` room (default starting room), the following movement buttons are now active:

- **⬅️ West Button**: `controlroom` (clickable, functional)
- **🪑 Sit Button**: `hiddenlab` (clickable, functional)

### ✅ Other Action Buttons
All other QuickActionsPanel buttons are also active:
- **👁️ Look Around**: Opens look modal
- **✋ Pick Up**: Opens pickup modal  
- **🖱️ Use Item**: Opens use item modal
- **🎒 Inventory**: Opens inventory modal
- **👋 Press**: Triggers press action
- **☕ Coffee**: Triggers coffee action
- **🔊 Sound Toggle**: Toggles audio
- **📺 Fullscreen**: Toggles fullscreen
- **↶ Back**: Returns to previous room (when available)

## Technical Details

### Room Exit System
The movement buttons display based on `room.exits` object:
- Standard directions: `north`, `south`, `east`, `west`
- Special actions: `jump`, `sit`
- Only directions with valid exits show buttons

### Button Logic
```typescript
const availableDirections = {
  north: Boolean(room?.exits?.north),   // ❌ controlnexus has no north exit
  south: Boolean(room?.exits?.south),   // ❌ controlnexus has no south exit  
  east: Boolean(room?.exits?.east),     // ❌ controlnexus has no east exit
  west: Boolean(room?.exits?.west),     // ✅ controlnexus → controlroom
  jump: Boolean(room?.exits?.jump),     // ❌ controlnexus has no jump exit
  sit: Boolean(room?.exits?.sit)        // ✅ controlnexus → hiddenlab
};
```

### Sample Room Data (controlnexus)
```typescript
exits: {
  west: 'controlroom',  // ✅ Shows West arrow button
  sit: 'hiddenlab'      // ✅ Shows Sit chair button  
}
```

## Movement Button Actions

### West Button (⬅️)
- **Target**: `controlroom` (Primary Control Room)
- **Action**: `onMove("west")` → `handleRoomChange('controlroom')`
- **Visual**: Left arrow icon
- **Tooltip**: "West (controlroom)"

### Sit Button (🪑)
- **Target**: `hiddenlab` (Hidden Laboratory)  
- **Action**: `onSit()` → `handleRoomChange('hiddenlab')`
- **Visual**: Chair icon (changes to standing person when sitting)
- **Tooltip**: "Sit (hiddenlab)"
- **State**: Shows visual feedback during sit animation

## Navigation Flow

### From controlnexus, players can:
1. **Move West** → `controlroom` (tactical operations center)
2. **Sit in Chair** → `hiddenlab` (hidden research facility)

### Each destination room will have its own available exits
- `controlroom`: Has exits back east to controlnexus, north to introreset, down to hiddenlab
- `hiddenlab`: Connected to multiple rooms in the facility network

## Production vs Development

### Development Mode (Current)
- ✅ Immediate access to movement buttons
- ✅ Skip intro sequence
- ✅ Default player name "TestPlayer"  
- ✅ Start in `stage: 'game'`

### Production Mode
- 🎭 Full intro sequence required
- 🎬 Proper narrative progression
- 📝 Player name capture
- 🎯 Transition animations between intro and main game

## Verification

The movement buttons are now **fully reactivated and functional**:
- Buttons appear in the QuickActionsPanel (bottom-right quad)
- Clicking West or Sit buttons triggers room transitions
- Visual feedback and tooltips work correctly
- All existing functionality preserved

Players can now navigate the game world using the intuitive movement buttons as intended!
