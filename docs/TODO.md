## üö® RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk Areas
1. **State Management Complexity** - Large state object with many interdependencies
2. **Room Loading System** - Dynamic imports could fail on missing modules
3. **Memory Leaks** - Timer cleanup and effect dependencies need monitoring
4. **Asset Loading** - Missing images/audio could break immersion
5. **Mobile Compatibility** - Complex UI may not work well on small screens

### Technical Debt
1. **Large Components** - AppCore.tsx is 1,259 lines and needs refactoring
2. **Type Safety Gaps** - Some `any` types remain in the codebase
3. **Error Handling** - Inconsistent error handling patterns
4. **Performance** - No performance monitoring or optimization
5. **Browser Compatibility** - Modern features may not work in older browsers

### Game Logic Risks
1. **Save/Load System** - Complex state serialization could corrupt saves
2. **Flag Dependencies** - Interconnected flags could create impossible states
3. **NPC Logic** - Complex interaction patterns might have edge cases
4. **Achievement System** - Achievement triggers could fire incorrectly
5. **Timer Management** - Multiple concurrent timers could conflict

## üìã PR & COMMIT STRATEGY

### Small, Focused PRs
1. **QuickActions Fix** - Movement button functionality + tests
2. **NPC Modal Improvements** - Input clearing + wandering verification
3. **Teleport Overlays** - Zone-aware effects + sound integration
4. **Death System** - Lives tracking + respawn flow
5. **Asset Swap System** - GIF fallback + performance guardrails
6. **Testing Infrastructure** - Jest setup + CI integration

### Each PR Must Include
- [ ] **Summary of Intent** - Clear description of changes
- [ ] **Risk Assessment** - Logic preserved, verification methods
- [ ] **Test Evidence** - Unit tests and/or smoke test results
- [ ] **Manual QA Steps** - Step-by-step testing instructions
- [ ] **Performance Impact** - Memory/speed considerations
- [ ] **Breaking Changes** - API or behavior changes noted
