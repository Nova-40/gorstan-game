# Heuristic & Flow Evaluation

## Onboarding & First 5 Minutes
- **Score**: 7/10
- **Evidence**: New Player (P1) reached the first meaningful choice within 2 minutes but encountered unclear objectives in the Control Room.
- **Suggestions**: Add clearer signposting for objectives in early rooms.

## Goals & Wayfinding
- **Score**: 6/10
- **Evidence**: Guided Player (P2) relied on "What now?" prompts frequently, indicating insufficient natural wayfinding.
- **Suggestions**: Improve exit clarity and add subtle environmental cues.

## Puzzles & Difficulty Curve
- **Score**: 8/10
- **Evidence**: Returning Player (P3) solved all puzzles without hints, but Guided Player (P2) required strong hints for a Tier-3 puzzle.
- **Suggestions**: Adjust hint cadence for higher-tier puzzles.

## Interaction Feel
- **Score**: 7/10
- **Evidence**: Feedback was generally responsive (<150ms), but some actions lacked micro-delights (e.g., solving puzzles).
- **Suggestions**: Add celebratory animations or sound effects for key interactions.

## NPC Conversations & Ayla
- **Score**: 6/10
- **Evidence**: NPC loops were rare but occurred in the Control Room (P2). Ayla's hints were helpful but sometimes delayed.
- **Suggestions**: Implement anti-loop logic and faster hint delivery.

## Traversal & Teleport
- **Score**: 5/10
- **Evidence**: Teleport delays and unclear objectives post-teleport were noted (P3).
- **Suggestions**: Add destination previews and arrival orientation.

## Cognitive Load & UI Hygiene
- **Score**: 7/10
- **Evidence**: Interface was readable but cluttered in some areas (e.g., Maze Zone).
- **Suggestions**: Reduce message density and improve iconography.

## Save/Resume
- **Score**: 8/10
- **Evidence**: Recap clarity was strong (P3), but next steps were occasionally unclear.
- **Suggestions**: Add explicit next-step suggestions in the recap.

## Accessibility
- **Score**: 6/10
- **Evidence**: No text scaling or high-contrast options were available.
- **Suggestions**: Add accessibility toggles for text size and contrast.

## Bugs/Softlocks
- **Score**: 9/10
- **Evidence**: No softlocks were encountered, but minor feedback issues were noted.
- **Suggestions**: Address missing feedback in Maze Zone.

## Replayability & Short Sessions
- **Score**: 7/10
- **Evidence**: Short-session loops were satisfying but lacked optional paths.
- **Suggestions**: Add side objectives and richer Aylaâ†”NPC interactions.

---

## Summary
- **Overall Score**: 7/10
- **Key Strengths**: Engaging puzzles, responsive interactions, strong save/resume system.
- **Key Weaknesses**: Wayfinding, teleport clarity, and accessibility options.

### Next Steps
1. Address critical issues (e.g., unclear objectives, teleport feedback).
2. Implement quality-of-life improvements (e.g., accessibility toggles, micro-delights).
3. Explore optional paths and richer interactions for replayability.
