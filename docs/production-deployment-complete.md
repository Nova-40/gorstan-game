## 🎮 **Player Experience Changes**

### **Before (Static Responses):**
```
Player: "I need help with this puzzle"
Ayla: "Look around carefully. The answer is usually nearby."
Player: "I'm still confused" 
Ayla: "Look around carefully. The answer is usually nearby." [Same]
```

### **Now (AI-Enhanced):**
```
Player: "I need help with this puzzle"
Ayla: "*thoughtful gaze* The answer isn't always in what you see, but in understanding what this room expects from you. What patterns have you noticed?

Player: "I'm still confused"
Ayla: "*nods knowingly* Confusion is the beginning of understanding. Try approaching each element systematically - the pedestals, the lighting, how they respond to your presence.
```
