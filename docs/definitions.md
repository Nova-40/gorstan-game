## Chair Sitting System

### Summary
Comprehensive chair sitting system in the crossing room with dynamic press button providing teleportation menus based on player inventory.

### Implementation Details

#### Chair Sitting System (`commandProcessor.ts`)

**Enhanced 'sit' Command:**
- **Location**: Crossing room (`crossing` or `introZone_crossing`)
- **Trigger**: `sit`, `sit chair`, `sit in chair`

**Sitting Experience:**
```
ðŸª‘ You approach the white chair and slowly lower yourself into it...
â†’ The chair feels strange at first - not quite designed for human anatomy.
â†’ But then something remarkable happens: the chair begins to mold itself around you!
âœ¨ The surface adjusts, supporting every curve of your body perfectly.
ðŸª‘ This becomes the most comfortable chair you have ever experienced in your life.
âš¡ A soft glow emanates from the armrest, revealing a subtle "Press" button.
ðŸ’¡ Type "press" to access the chair's navigation system.
```

**State Management:**
- Sets flag: `sittingInCrossingChair: true`
- Enables press button functionality
- Updates QuickActions UI

#### Press Button System (`commandProcessor.ts`)

**Enhanced 'press' Command:**
- **Condition**: Player must be sitting in crossing chair (`sittingInCrossingChair: true`)
- **Triggers**: `press`, `press button`, `press press_button`, `press chair_button`

**Inventory-Based Access Levels:**

**With Remote Control (Full Access):**
- All hub rooms across all zones
- Excludes Stanton Harcourt rooms as requested
- **Destinations**: controlnexus, latticehub, gorstanhub, londonhub, mazehub, hiddenlab, controlroom, dalesapartment, gorstanvillage, lattice, datavoid, trentpark, stkatherinesdock, torridoninn, libraryofnine, mazeecho, elfhame, faepalacemainhall, newyorkhub, centralpark, manhattanhub

**Without Remote Control (Limited Access):**
- Coffee shop and Trent Park only
- **Destinations**: findlaterscornercoffeeshop, trentpark

#### Stand Up System (`commandProcessor.ts`)

**New 'stand' Command:**
- **Triggers**: `stand`, `get_up`, `stand_up`
- **Condition**: When sitting in crossing chair

**Standing Experience:**
```
ðŸª‘ You slowly rise from the incredibly comfortable chair...
â†’ The chair gracefully returns to its original simple white form.
âš¡ The glowing press button fades away as you step back.
â†’ You find yourself missing the perfect comfort already.
```

#### User Experience Flow

1. **Initial State** (in crossing room): Player sees "ðŸª‘ Sit in Chair" button in QuickActions
2. **Sitting State**: Chair molds to player's body, press button appears on armrest
3. **Press Button Interaction**: Shows holographic destination menu based on inventory
4. **Teleportation**: Uses existing `teleport [destination]` system
5. **Standing Up**: Chair returns to normal form, press button disappears

## Audio System

### Audio Fix Summary - Dramatic Wait Transition

**Issue Identified:**
The dramatic wait transition sounds were not playing due to:
1. **Missing audio files** - `splat.mp3`, `success.wav`, `fail.wav` were 0-byte placeholder files
2. **Browser autoplay restrictions** - Audio wasn't handling autoplay blocking properly
3. **No error feedback** - Users couldn't tell if audio was blocked or broken

**Solution Implemented:**

#### Audio File Mapping (Fixed)
- **ðŸŽº Truck Horn**: `/audio/truckhorn.mp3` (106,997 bytes) âœ… Working
- **ðŸ’¥ Impact Sound**: `/audio/keystroke.mp3` (6,104 bytes) âœ… Working (repurposed as impact)
- **ðŸ˜± Wilhelm Scream**: `/audio/wilhelm.mp3` (31,488 bytes) âœ… Working

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Safe Audio Playback**: `playAudioSafely()` function with proper error catching
- **Browser Compatibility**: Graceful handling of autoplay restrictions
- **Visual Feedback**: Audio blocked indicator shows when browser blocks sound
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging audio issues

#### Audio Initialization Improvements
- **Preloading**: Audio files preloaded with `preload='auto'`
- **Volume Control**: Optimized volume levels for each effect
- **Memory Cleanup**: Proper audio cleanup on component unmount
- **Error Recovery**: Continue animation even if audio fails

#### User Experience
**When Audio Works:**
1. **ðŸŽº Truck horn** plays immediately when transition starts
2. **ðŸ˜± Wilhelm scream** plays during impact stage
3. **ðŸ’¥ Keystroke impact** plays during splat stage
4. **Full dramatic experience** with synchronized audio/visual effects

**When Audio is Blocked:**
1. **ðŸ”‡ Visual indicator** shows "Audio blocked by browser - Visual effects only"
2. **Animation continues** normally without interruption
3. **Console messages** help developers debug audio issues
4. **Graceful fallback** maintains user experience

- **Multi-NPC encounters**: 10% chance for complex narrative sequences
- **Priority-based single encounters**: Remaining 20% distributed by NPC priority
- **Special NPCs preserved**: Mr. Wendell and Librarian maintain existing logic

**Multi-NPC Encounter Sequences:**
- **Tension Trio**: Morthos + Polly + Albie (emotional conflict scenarios)
- **Helper Duo**: Al + Albie (assistance for experienced players)
- **Philosophical Pair**: Dominic + Morthos (moral choice aftermath)
- **Wildcard Chaos**: Polly + Dominic (unpredictable interactions)

**Enhanced Behavioral System:**

- **Conflict resolution**: NPCs can displace, avoid, or coexist based on rules
- **Narrative context**: Special messages for multi-NPC encounters

#### Technical Implementation
- **Deterministic randomness**: Same room + same game state = same NPC outcome
- **Rate-limited**: Efficient cooldown management and performance optimization
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new NPCs, encounter sequences, and conditions
