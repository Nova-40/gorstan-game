# Librarian NPC Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Librarian NPC has been fully implemented as a sophisticated entity that appears in library rooms and presents the **Three Doors of Resolution** puzzle. This implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing wandering NPC system.

## Key Components Created/Modified

### 1. Core Librarian Controller (`src/engine/librarianController.ts`)
- **Spawn Logic**: 80% chance to appear in any room with "library" in ID, title, or description
- **Entry Tracking**: Tracks failed entry attempts, mentions them when finally appearing
- **Greasy Napkin Recognition**: Automatically detects napkin and unlocks scrolls
- **Puzzle System**: Complete Three Doors of Resolution implementation
- **Debug Support**: Full debug info and status checking

### 2. Integration with Wandering NPC System
- **npcSpawner.ts**: Added Librarian definition with high priority in library rooms
- **wanderingNPCController.ts**: 
  - Integrated Librarian spawn evaluation
  - Added interaction handling
  - Priority system (can displace Mr. Wendell in libraries)

### 3. Command Processing (`src/engine/commandProcessor.ts`)
- **Puzzle Commands**: "ask guard:", "enter [color] door"
- **Interaction Commands**: Talk to librarian, ask librarian
- **Debug Commands**: "librarian", "librarianstatus" (Geoff only)

### 4. UI Integration (`src/components/AppCore.tsx`)
- **Command Handling**: useEffect hooks for pending Librarian commands
- **Debug Support**: Status checking and forced spawning

## The Three Doors of Resolution Puzzle

### Trigger Conditions
1. Player must be in a library room
2. Player must have the "greasy napkin" item
3. Librarian spawns and recognizes the napkin as a "pass"
4. Scrolls are displayed explaining the puzzle mechanics
5. Three doors (red, blue, green) appear with guards

### Puzzle Mechanics
1. **Three Guards**: One tells truth, one lies, one is random
2. **One Question**: Player can ask only one question to one guard
3. **Correct Question**: "If I asked one of the other guards which door leads to Stanton Harcourt, what would they say?"
4. **Solution Logic**: Choose the OPPOSITE door from what the guard says
5. **Success**: Teleports to 'stantonZone_arrival' and unlocks puzzle_solver achievement
6. **Failure**: Teleports back to 'controlnexus' and resets puzzle

### Command Examples
```
ask guard: if i asked one of the other guards which door leads to stanton harcourt, what would they say
enter red door
enter blue door  
enter green door
talk to librarian
```

## Spawn Logic Details

### Library Room Detection
- Room ID contains "library" (case-insensitive)
- Room title contains "library" (case-insensitive)  
- Room description contains "library" (case-insensitive)

### Spawn Probability
- **80% chance** in library rooms
- **Entry attempt tracking**: If spawn fails, increments counter
- **Special greeting**: After 2+ failed attempts, mentions not noticing player before

### Priority System
- Priority 9 (very high, can displace most NPCs)
- Can temporarily displace Mr. Wendell in library rooms
- Exclusive spawning in libraries when active

## Achievement Integration
- **Unlocks**: `puzzle_solver` achievement when Three Doors puzzle is solved
- **Description**: "Mind Over Matter - Successfully solved a challenging puzzle"

## Debug Commands (Geoff only)
- **`librarian`**: Force spawn Librarian in next library room
- **`librarianstatus`**: Log detailed Librarian status to console
- Shows active state, current room, puzzle progress, and relevant flags

## Game State Integration

### Flags Used
- `hasUnlockedScrolls`: Set when greasy napkin is recognized
- `hasSolvedLibraryPuzzle`: Set when puzzle is completed successfully
- `pendingLibrarianCommand`: For async command processing
- `forceLibrarianSpawn`: Debug flag for forced spawning
- `checkLibrarianStatus`: Debug flag for status logging

### Inventory Integration
- Detects "greasy napkin", "greasily napkin", or "napkin" items
- Automatically triggers scroll revelation and puzzle presentation

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if room data is incomplete
- Proper validation of player commands
- Fallback messages for invalid puzzle interactions
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

## Testing Scenarios

### Basic Functionality
1. Enter any library room (latticeZone_library, hiddenlibrary, etc.)
2. Verify 80% spawn rate over multiple entries
3. Test entry attempt tracking

### Puzzle Flow
1. Obtain greasy napkin item
2. Enter library room until Librarian spawns
3. Verify automatic napkin recognition
4. Read scrolls sequence
5. Test puzzle commands
6. Test both success and failure paths

### Debug Features
1. Test `librarian` command in debug mode
2. Verify `librarianstatus` logging
3. Test forced spawning in library rooms

## Integration Notes
- Fully compatible with existing Mr. Wendell system
- Uses same message dispatch patterns as other NPCs
- Leverages existing achievement system
- Follows established flag-based state management
- Compatible with room transition animations

The Librarian implementation is now complete and ready for testing in the game environment.
