# Wait Timer & Dramatic Splat Animation Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a 5-minute wait timer system with dramatic splat animation that takes players to `introZone_crossing` with special rewards.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **5-Minute Wait Timer** (`TeletypeIntro.tsx`)
- ⏰ **5-minute countdown** timer starts when choices are displayed
- 🔴 **Visual timer display** in top-right corner
- ⚠️ **Progressive warnings** at 1 minute, 30 seconds, and 10 seconds
- 🚛 **Auto-trigger** dramatic wait sequence when timer reaches 0:00

### 2. **Enhanced Timer UI**
- **Timer Display**: Shows `mm:ss` format countdown
- **Color-coded warnings**: 
  - Normal: Red background
  - ≤60 seconds: Yellow warning text
  - ≤30 seconds: Red pulsing "Wait" button
  - ≤10 seconds: Bouncing "IMPACT IMMINENT" message

### 3. **Dramatic Wait Transition** (`DramaticWaitTransitionOverlay.tsx`)
- **6 Progressive Stages**:
  1. **Approaching**: Red glow with truck icon and engine sounds
  2. **Warning**: Intense screen shake with danger warnings
  3. **Impact**: Blinding white flash with explosive effects
  4. **Splat**: Dramatic blood-red overlay with "SPLAT." message
  5. **Void**: Complete darkness with minimal text
  6. **Reconstruction**: Reality rebuilding sequence

### 4. **Audio Integration**
- 🔊 **Truck horn** plays on approach
- 😱 **Wilhelm scream** during impact
- 💥 **Splat sound** effect
- 🎵 **Automatic cleanup** prevents audio overlap

### 5. **Destination & Rewards**
- **Destination**: `introZone_crossing` (The Infinite Crossing)
- **Special Items**: 
  - ☕ `quantum_coffee` - Impossibly intact after impact
  - 🔑 `dales_apartment_key` - Access to Dale's apartment

### 6. **Enhanced Crossing Room** (`introZone_crossing.ts`)
- **New Description**: References dramatic arrival survivors
- **Special Interactables**:
  - ☕ **Quantum Coffee**: Defies physics, interactive object
  - 🚪 **Apartment Door**: Only visible with apartment key
- **Direct Access**: Door to Dale's apartment for key holders
- **Remote Control**: Already available in Dale's apartment

### 7. **Route Configuration**
- **Timer Routes**: Both manual "wait" and auto "dramatic_wait" use same destination
- **Inventory Bonus**: `['quantum_coffee', 'dales_apartment_key']`
- **Integration**: Full compatibility with existing game state system

## User Experience Flow

### Option 3: Timer Pressure
