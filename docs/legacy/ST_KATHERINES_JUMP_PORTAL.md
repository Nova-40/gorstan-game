- **Portal Features**: 
  - Perfect jumping height
  - NYC skyline visible through surface

## Technical Implementation
- **Exit System**: Both `portal` and `jump` exits lead to same destination
- **Command Handling**: Enhanced jump command processor for special messaging
- **Room Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing portal mechanics

## Usage Notes
Players can now choose their style of interdimensional travel:
- Conservative players can use `portal` for careful transit
- Adventurous players can use `jump` for dramatic flair
- Both methods are functionally equivalent but provide different narrative experiences

The jump option adds an element of player choice and personality expression while maintaining the same game mechanics and destination.
