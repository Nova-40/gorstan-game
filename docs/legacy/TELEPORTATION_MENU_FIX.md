# Teleportation Menu Button Fix

## Issue
The teleportation menu in the crossing room was not showing when the player pressed the button, despite having the remote control or navigation crystal.

## Root Cause
The QuickActions component was checking for `state.currentRoomId === 'crossing'` but the actual room ID in the game state is `'introZone_crossing'` (based on the file naming convention and how the room is registered).

## Solution
Updated the QuickActions.tsx component to check for both possible room ID formats:

### Before
```tsx
{inventory.includes('remote_control') && state.currentRoomId === 'crossing' && (
```

### After  
```tsx
{inventory.includes('remote_control') && (state.currentRoomId === 'crossing' || state.currentRoomId === 'introZone_crossing') && (
```

## Files Modified
- `src/components/QuickActions.tsx` - Updated room ID checking logic for both remote control and navigation crystal buttons

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build verification successful (2123 modules transformed)
- ✅ No syntax errors detected

## How It Works Now
1. When player enters the crossing room (`introZone_crossing`)
2. If they have a `remote_control` in inventory → "Use Remote" button appears
3. If they have a `navigation_crystal` but no remote control → "Use Crystal" button appears  
4. Clicking either button opens the TeleportationMenu modal
5. Player can select from available destinations based on their device

## Destination Access Levels
- **Remote Control**: Full access to 19+ destinations across all zones
- **Navigation Crystal**: Limited access to Trent Park and Findlater's Corner Coffee Shop

The teleportation system is now fully functional and will properly display the menu when players press the button in the crossing room.
