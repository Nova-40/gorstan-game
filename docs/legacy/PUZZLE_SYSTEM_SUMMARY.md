- **Typography Hierarchy:** Clear information architecture

### üèÜ Comprehensive Reward System
- **Score Progression:** Point-based achievement system
- **Item Collection:** Puzzle-specific reward items
- **Achievement Unlocks:** Special recognition for puzzle mastery
- **Story Integration:** Narrative progression through puzzle completion

### üìä Advanced Analytics
- **Progress Tracking:** Per-room completion statistics
- **Attempt Monitoring:** Failed attempt tracking with limits
- **Hint Usage Analytics:** Strategic hint consumption tracking
- **Success Rate Analysis:** Performance metrics for puzzle types

## Integration Points

### Command Processor Enhancement
- Existing puzzle commands in `commandProcessor.ts` lines 972-1540
- Enhanced with world-class puzzle interface integration
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing puzzle system

### Game State Integration
- Seamless integration with `LocalGameState` management
- Type-safe puzzle state handling with proper error handling
- Progressive enhancement approach for existing game features

### Room-Based Puzzle System
- Automatic puzzle discovery based on room configuration
- Dynamic puzzle availability based on player progress
- Context-aware puzzle recommendations

## Technical Excellence

### TypeScript Integration
- **Full Type Safety:** Comprehensive type definitions for all puzzle components
- **Generic Interfaces:** Flexible puzzle data structures
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation and error recovery
- **Module System:** Clean separation of concerns with proper imports/exports

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading:** Dynamic imports for puzzle components
- **State Optimization:** Efficient state management with minimal re-renders
- **Bundle Splitting:** Optimized build output with chunk splitting
- **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup and resource management

### Build System Compatibility
- **Vite Integration:** Optimized for modern build tools
- **Hot Module Replacement:** Development-friendly with instant updates
- **Production Ready:** Successfully builds with no compilation errors
- **Bundle Size:** Maintains excellent bundle size optimization (106.66 kB gzipped)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Puzzle Commands
```bash
puzzle list              # Show available puzzles in current area
puzzle solve three_doors # Start the Three Doors of Resolution
puzzle progress          # Show completion statistics
solve rune_sequence      # Quick solve command
```

### Developer Integration
```typescript
import PuzzleController from './engine/puzzleController';
import { PuzzleInterface } from './components/PuzzleInterface';

// Start a puzzle session
const controller = PuzzleController.getInstance();
const session = await controller.startPuzzle('three_doors', roomId, gameState);
```
