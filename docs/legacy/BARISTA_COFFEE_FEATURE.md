# Barista Coffee Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added an automatic coffee offering system to Findlater's Corner Coffee Shop where the barista Sarah calls out "Coffee for Pyke!" and offers free coffee to the player when they enter the room without coffee in their inventory.

## Implementation Details

### Room Modifications (londonZone_findlaterscornercoffeeshop.ts)

#### Events Enhanced
- **onEnter Events**: Added `offerCoffeeAutomatically` to the existing entry events
- **onExit Events**: Added `resetCoffeeOfferFlag` to reset the offer when leaving

#### NPC Dialogue Updated
- **Sarah the Barista**: Enhanced dialogue to include:
  - `greeting`: Now includes "Coffee for Pyke!" callout
  - `offer_coffee`: New dialogue for offering free coffee
  - `no_coffee_needed`: Response when player already has coffee

#### Custom Actions Added
- **accept_free_coffee**: New action for accepting the barista's complimentary coffee

#### Flags Added
- **freeCoffeeOffered**: Tracks if coffee has been offered this visit
- **coffeeForPykeCalled**: Records that the "Coffee for Pyke" callout occurred

### Engine Modifications (commandProcessor.ts)

#### New Function: processRoomEvents
- Handles room event processing for both entry and exit events
- **offerCoffeeAutomatically**: 
  - Only triggers in coffee shop when player lacks coffee
  - Prevents duplicate offers per visit
  - Adds coffee to inventory automatically
  - Displays "Coffee for Pyke!" message and barista dialogue
- **resetCoffeeOfferFlag**: Resets the offer flag when leaving the coffee shop

#### Enhanced processRoomEntry
- Now calls `processRoomEvents` for onEnter events
- Integrates with existing trap processing

#### Movement Commands Enhanced
- Both `go/move` and directional commands now process:
  - **Exit Events**: Before leaving current room
  - **Entry Events**: When entering new room
- Proper state management ensures events affect subsequent processing

## Behavior

### When Player Enters Coffee Shop Without Coffee:
1. "Coffee for Pyke!" callout appears immediately
2. Barista offers coffee with warm dialogue
3. Coffee is automatically added to player inventory
4. Success message confirms receipt
5. Flag prevents duplicate offers during same visit

### When Player Enters Coffee Shop With Coffee:
- No automatic offer (player already has coffee)
- Regular barista interactions remain available

### When Player Leaves Coffee Shop:
- Coffee offer flag resets
- Player can receive coffee again on next visit (if they don't have any)
