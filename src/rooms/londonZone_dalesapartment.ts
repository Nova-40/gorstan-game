  title: 'Dale and Polly\'s Apartment',
  description: [
    'You step into a bright, immaculately clean apartment that feels almost unnaturally tidy. Every surface gleams, every book is perfectly aligned, and not a single item appears out of place.',
    'The living room is decorated in modern minimalist style with clean lines and neutral colors. A comfortable sofa faces a wall-mounted television, while floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with natural light.',
    'In one corner of the lounge, a large fish tank bubbles quietly. Inside, a single goldfish named Dominic swims in lazy circles, seemingly the only living thing that doesn\'t conform to the apartment\'s rigid organization.',
    'The level of tidiness borders on obsessive - it\'s as if someone has been maintaining this place as a shrine, keeping everything exactly as it was meant to be, waiting for its occupants to return.',
