  title: 'Rhianon\'s Private Chamber',
  description: [
    'You enter the private chamber of Rhianon, one of the most powerful Fae nobles. The room is a study in elegant contrasts - walls of deepest midnight blue are studded with points of light that shift like captured stars, while furniture of pale silver wood seems to glow with its own inner radiance.',
    'A large window dominates one wall, but instead of showing the palace grounds, it displays a constantly shifting view of different realms and times. Through it, you can see alien worlds, distant futures, and memories of the distant past.',
    'The air is perfumed with the scent of night-blooming flowers and something else - the sharp, clean smell of magic being woven. Books float in the air around the room, their pages turning by themselves as they read their own contents.',
    'This is clearly the private space of someone with immense power and equally immense knowledge. Every object here hums with magic, and you sense that disturbing the wrong thing could have consequences beyond imagining.',
