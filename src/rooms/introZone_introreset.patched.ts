  title: 'The Reset Chamber',
  description: [
    'You stand in a peculiar chamber where the very fabric of reality seems unstable. The walls shimmer with an otherworldly quality, and the dimensions feel subtly wrong - distances appear to shift when you\'re not looking directly at them.',
    'At the center of the room sits an ornate chair that seems to pulse with dimensional energy. Strange symbols carved into its armrests glow faintly with an inner light.',
    'Mounted on the far wall is a large, bright blue button enclosed in a protective transparent case. Whatever you do, do not press it. The psychic paper next to it flickers with warnings that seem oddly personal. It feels as though the button is aware of you. Above it, a sign made of what appears to be psychic paper shifts and changes, always displaying text in whatever language you can read.',
    'Near the chair, an emergency runbag sits half-zipped, apparently left by a previous visitor. It looks like it could increase your carrying capacity.',
    'In one corner, a small dimensional bubble floats impossibly in mid-air, containing what appears to be a fish swimming in its own pocket of water. The fish looks at you with surprising intelligence.',
    'The air itself feels thick with potential, as if this place exists at the intersection of multiple realities. You can sense that choices made here will have far-reaching consequences.',
