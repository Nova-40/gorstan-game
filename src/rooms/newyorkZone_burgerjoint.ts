  description: [
    'You step into a classic New York burger joint that looks like it\'s been serving the neighborhood for decades. Red vinyl booths line the walls, and the black-and-white checkered floor shows years of faithful service.',
    'The smell of grilling beef and fresh fries fills the air, making your mouth water despite everything else going on. A large grill dominates the open kitchen, where a burly chef works with practiced efficiency.',
    'Behind the counter, menu boards display simple offerings - burgers, fries, sodas, and not much else. This is the kind of place that does one thing and does it perfectly.',
    'The chef looks up as you enter, wiping his hands on his apron. He has the weathered look of someone who\'s seen it all, but his eyes hold a sharpness that suggests there\'s more to this place than meets the eye.',
