  title: 'Findlater\'s Corner Coffee Shop',
  description: [
    'You step into a cozy corner coffee shop that feels eerily familiar, though you can\'t quite place when you\'ve been here before. The warm aroma of freshly ground coffee beans fills the air, mixing with the scent of pastries and the gentle hum of conversation.',
    'Mismatched vintage furniture creates intimate seating areas throughout the space. Exposed brick walls are adorned with local artwork and old photographs of the neighborhood. Soft jazz plays in the background, adding to the welcoming atmosphere.',
    'Behind the polished wooden counter, a friendly barista with bright eyes and a warm smile has already begun preparing a coffee before you even approached. She works with practiced efficiency, as if she knew exactly what you wanted.',
    'The morning light streams through large windows, casting golden patterns across the worn wooden floors. This place has the comfortable feel of somewhere you\'ve spent countless hours, even though the specific memories remain frustratingly just out of reach.',
