  title: 'Northern Shore of the Fae Lake',
  description: [
    'You stand on the northern shore of the Fae Lake, where the crystalline waters lap gently against a beach of pearl-white sand. From this vantage point, you can see the full majesty of the lake stretching southward, its surface reflecting the eternal twilight sky.',
    'To the north, the land rises toward the magnificent Fae Palace, its crystalline spires visible through the silver-leaved trees. A path of smooth white stones leads up from the shore, winding through gardens of impossible beauty.',
    'The air here carries the scent of water lilies and distant spices, mixed with the ozone-like smell of concentrated magic. Butterflies with wings like stained glass flutter between the flowering bushes that line the path.',
    'This feels like a place of transition - between the wild magic of the lake and the more ordered power of the palace above. The very stones seem to hum with anticipation.',
