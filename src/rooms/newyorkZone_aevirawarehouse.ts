  description: [
    'You stand before an imposing industrial warehouse in a less-traveled part of Manhattan. The building\'s exterior gives nothing away - gray concrete walls, minimal windows, and a single reinforced door marked only with the number "47".',
    'Through the reinforced glass windows, you can glimpse sophisticated equipment inside - high-end printers, laminating machines, and computers that clearly aren\'t being used for legitimate business purposes. This is clearly a sophisticated forgery operation.',
    'A burly security guard named Albie sits behind a desk just inside the entrance, his watchful eyes tracking every movement on the street. He looks like the kind of person who doesn\'t ask questions but demands the right answers.',
    'The air around the building hums with the quiet efficiency of illegal enterprise - a place where any government document or credit card from anywhere in the world can be expertly crafted for the right price and proper authorization.',
