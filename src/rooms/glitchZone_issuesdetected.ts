    "The fabric of reality seems to be tearing apart in this area. Glitches and visual artifacts flicker in and out of existence, and the air crackles with unstable energy.",
    "Warning messages cascade down translucent screens that flicker in and out of existence. The environment pulses with instabilityâ€”walls occasionally pixelate and reform, the floor sometimes gives way to glimpses of raw data streams beneath.",
    "Red warning lights strobe intermittently, casting everything in an urgent, alarm-like glow. Floating holographic displays show cascading error messages, system diagnostics, and repair protocols.",
    "It's as if you've stepped inside a computer that's desperately trying to fix itself. The only way out may be to intervene directly with the system's failing logic."
