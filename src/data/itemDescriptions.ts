  torch: "A flickering torch with a faint smell of oil. Looks like it’s been used to read cryptic messages.",
  napkin: "A greasy napkin. Surprisingly stiff. Feels more like a key than a serviette.",
  dominic: "A small goldfish with big, worried eyes. He looks at you as if he knows the ending.",
  coffee: "Still warm. Smells of hazelnut and misplaced ambition.",
  batteries: "Two AA batteries, still charged. There's a tiny rabbit logo on the side.",
  mirror: "A tall, ornate mirror with a frame that shimmers strangely. It doesn't always reflect what's in front of it.",
  moss: "A soft green moss that covers the stones like memory clinging to forgotten places.",
  portal: "A shimmering veil of light that pulses softly. It hums with multiversal energy.",
  bookshelf: "Creaky, dust-lined shelves brimming with unreadable tomes and unspoken secrets.",
  bookshelf2: "This one is empty. Or was. There's a faint outline where something heavy once rested.",
  books: "Tomes bound in skin, time, and bureaucracy. They whisper if you’re too close.",
  trolley: "A rusty trolley with one wonky wheel. It’s currently home to a very opinionated goldfish.",
  console: "An old terminal blinking sporadically. Commands scrawl themselves across it when no one's watching.",
  button: "A large blue button with a tiny note: ‘Do not press again.’ It dares you.",
  coin: "A cursed coin from another realm. It feels oddly warm in your hand, like it remembers things.",

  silver: "The bark of a tree glows silver under the starlight, untouched by decay or logic.",

  machine: "A whirring device. Possibly vital. Possibly decorative. Certainly ominous.",
  runbag: "A government-issued survival pack with reinforced zippers. Doubles as an emotional support item.",
  deadfish: "A lifeless goldfish. You’re not sure if it’s Dominic. That makes it worse.",
  keycard: "A thin plastic card with faded lettering. It smells faintly of stress and printer toner.",
  notebook: "A spiral-bound notebook filled with anxious handwriting and half-redacted ideas.",
  scroll_constitution: "A vellum scroll embossed with luminous text. You feel like it’s watching you back.",
  mirror_shard: "A jagged piece of mirror. It reflects things you haven't done yet.",
  circuit: "A burnt-out fragment of alien circuitry. You think it just blinked.",
  ai_core: "A pulsing crystal orb encased in steel. It murmurs logic in your peripheral hearing.",
  watch: "A cracked watch. Time moves when you’re not looking — just not always forward.",
  dustyfile: "An old personnel file marked ‘CLASSIFIED’. Most of it has been aggressively redacted.",
  terminal: "A miniature console node. It’s offline, but your name flashes briefly on the screen.",
  rubberchicken: "Exactly what it sounds like. Why is this even here?",
